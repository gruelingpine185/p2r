# Digital Project

This is my revamped History 101 Digital Project assignment. This is repo was rebuilt to be more maintainable and easier to extend. Unlike the [original website](https://github.com/gruelingpine185/his101), extra steps need to be taken to get this working properly.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

## Local Hosting

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gruelingpine185/p2r
cd ./p2r
```

2. Install project dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

3. Start the NodeJS server

```sh
node .
```

Once the program is running, it will output a link pointing to the local host. Open it in a browser to view the site.

4. Don't forget to terminate NodeJS

After viewing the website, go back to the terminal and press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server.

## Screenshots

As development continues, feel free to check the `screenshots/` directory for fullpage screenshots. This is alternative to dealing with NodeJS if it isn't already set up. I'll make an effort to keep them up to date.
