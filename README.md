# Digital Project

This is my revamped History 101 Digital Project assignment. This is repo was rebuilt to be more maintainable and easier to extend. Unlike the original website, extra steps need to be taken to get this working properly.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

## Local Hosting

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gruelingpine185/p2r
cd ./p2r
```

2. Start the NodeJS server

```sh
node .
```

Once running, the program will output a link pointing to the local host. Open it in a browser to view the site.

3. Don't forget to terminate NodeJS

After viewing the website, go back to the terminal and press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server.
